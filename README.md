## How StreamR Works 📱

StreamR does more than just recommend movies. Here’s what’s under the hood:

- Analyzes movie characteristics like genre and user reviews to make informed suggestions.
- Combines movie features and user preferences using machine learning for truly personalized picks.
- Suggests trailers for your top recommendations so you can preview before you watch. 
- Learns from feedback and improves recommendations with time.
- Lets you create an account, track movie history, add to watchlist, edit profile, and refine your recommendations.
